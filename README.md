Database - PGAdmin (PostgresSQL)

Java - Libraries: d3, plotly, leaflet, chart

Installation of Flask Cors is required - Use pip install -U flask-cors 

## Process:

### Extract :

Open python file and Import csv files into Pandas 

### Transform:

Transform tables to formal specification

##### Data Modelling - Tables :

Create the tables using www.quickdatabase.com 

### Load:

Connect to postgres SQL database -> load data.

Formal specification to be created that defines the tables format can be imported into postgres SQL database.
